<h1>The <em>fizzbuzz</em> <strong>for loop</strong></h1>

<p>
	So for this project all I did was create a for loop that logs out numbers 1-100.  The only difference is that I also used the fizzbuzz "technique" which will alert <em>"fizz", "buzz, or "fizzbuzz"</em> when certain conditions are met.
</p>

<p>
	In this case everytime a number is generated, it is also calculated to see if it is divisible by a 3 or 5 or a 5 and 5, in which case it would alert a specific string.
</p>

<p>
	This is an example of using an <strong>if/else</strong> statements witin <strong>for loops</strong>.
